# HybridsProject
This is a study on genetic basis for extensive divergence in developmental gene expression during life history evolution in sea urchin Heliocidaris.

To reproduce the results:
1. Download the Rmd file and the rawdata folder with all data files in the folder.
2. In RStudio, set the working dirctory as the folder where the Rmd file and raw data are saved. 
3. After running the Rmd file, an output folder will be generated and all the results will be saved in the output folder.
4. To repeart, delete the output folder and run the Rmd file again. 
5. The entire process takes hours to finish.
