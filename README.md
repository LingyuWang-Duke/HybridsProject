# HybridsProject
This is a study on genetic basis for extensive divergence in developmental gene expression during life history evolution in sea urchin Heliocidaris

# To reproduce the results:
# 1. download the Rmd file and the rawdata folder with all data files in the folder.
# 2. in Rstudio, set the working dirctory as the folder where the Rmd file and raw data are saved. 
# 3. after running the Rmd file, an output folder will be generated and all the results will be saved in the output folder.
# 4. to repeart, delete the output folder and run the Rmd file again. 
# 5. the entire process takes hours to finish.
